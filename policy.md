## Processing of your data

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.
From the moment a user turns on our service, their Internet data becomes private and safety. We guarantees a strict no-logs policy for our service, meaning that your activities using our service are provided by automated technical process, are not monitored, recorded, logged, stored or passed to any third party. We do not store connection time stamps, session information, used bandwidth, traffic logs, IP addresses or other data. Any online traffic coming from user’s device is no longer visible to ISP, third-party snoopers or cyber criminals.
